# California BRFSS (2014-2022) â€“ Disaggregated Health Analysis

## Introduction
This repository contains code for analyzing the California Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) microdata (2014-2022) with a focus on disaggregating health indicators by detailed race/ethnicity groups. The analysis applies survey weighting, multiple imputation for missing data, age standardization, and predictive marginal standardization to ensure robust estimates.

Key health indicators include:
- **Lifestyle factors** (smoking, alcohol use, physical activity)
- **Preventive healthcare** (vaccinations, screenings, access to care)
- **Chronic conditions** (diabetes, asthma, cardiovascular conditions, obesity, mental health)
- **General health status** (fair or poor general health status, poor mental/physical health days)
- **Disabilities** (vision impairment, cognitive difficulty, mobility limitations)

## Data Availability and Access
The California BRFSS microdata used in this project **are not publicly available** and must be requested directly from the California Department of Public Health (CDPH).

### How to Request BRFSS Data:
1. Visit the [CDPH BRFSS Data Request Page](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DCDIC/CDSRB/Pages/BRFSS.aspx)
2. Complete a Data Use Agreement (DUA) with CDPH.
3. Once approved, download the **SAS-format (.sas7bdat) files**.
4. After obtaining the data, place them in the **raw data directory** specified in `config.R`.

## Setup Instructions
### Step 1: Download this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/lamhine/brfss_ca.git
cd brfss_ca
```
Or download the ZIP manually from GitHub and extract it.

### Step 2: Configure file paths
- Copy `config_example.R` to `config.R`:
```
cp config_example.R config.R
```
- Open `config.R` in **RStudio** and **update the paths** for:
  - `raw_data_dir`: The folder containing `.sas7bdat` files from CDPH.
  - `processed_data_dir`: The location where cleaned files will be stored.
  - `results_dir`: The location where final tables, plots, and reports will be saved.

### Step 3: Open the RStudio Project (`brfss_disagg.Rproj`).

### Step 4: Run the analysis pipeline in R
```
source("02_scripts/01_load_data.R")            # Loads raw BRFSS data
source("02_scripts/02_clean_data.R")           # Cleans and preprocesses data
source("02_scripts/03_define_race_categories.R") # Creates detailed race/ethnicity categories
source("02_scripts/04_multiple_imputation.R")  # Handles missing data with multiple imputation
source("02_scripts/05_create_survey_designs.R") # Constructs weighted survey design objects
source("02_scripts/06_summarize_data.R")       # Generates weighted tables of key health indicators
source("02_scripts/07_standardize_data.R")     # Performs direct standardization & modeling
source("02_scripts/08_visualize_data.R")       # Generates final tables, heatmaps, and plots
```

## Outputs and File Structure
| File/Folder | Description |
|-------------|------------|
| `01_data/` | Stores intermediate and final processed datasets. |
| `02_scripts/` | Contains all R scripts for data processing, analysis, and visualization. |
| `02_scripts/01_load_data.R` | Reads raw `.sas7bdat` files and merges 2014-2022 BRFSS data. |
| `02_scripts/02_clean_data.R` | Cleans variables, handles missing values, and applies factor recoding. |
| `02_scripts/03_define_race_categories.R` | Cleans and creates detailed race/ethnicity categories. |
| `02_scripts/04_multiple_imputation.R` | Uses multiple imputation for missing data. |
| `02_scripts/05_create_survey_designs.R` | Constructs survey designs and applies survey weights. |
| `02_scripts/06_summarize_data.R` | Computes weighted prevalence estimates and descriptive statistics. |
| `02_scripts/07_standardize_data.R` | Performs direct standardization and predictive modeling. |
| `02_scripts/08_visualize_data.R` | Generates final tables, figures, and heatmaps. |
| `03_results/` | Stores tables, plots, and final output files. |
| `config_example.R` | Template for setting up file paths. |
| `README.md` | Project documentation. |
| `setup.R` | Defines variable groups and other preprocessing settings. |

## Troubleshooting
- **Data loading errors?** Ensure `.sas7bdat` files are placed in the correct `raw_data_dir`.
- **`config.R` errors?** Double-check that paths are set correctly.
- **RStudio errors?** Always open the `.Rproj` file before running scripts.
- **Missing packages?** Install them using:
```
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "haven", "survey", "janitor", "summarytools"))
```
